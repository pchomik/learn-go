## 📖 About This Repository

Welcome to my personal **Go learning journey**! This repository contains my solutions and experiments while learning the Go programming language through a **dual learning approach** - combining the official [Go Tour](https://go.dev/tour/) with practical exercises from [Exercism's Go track](https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises).

### 🌟 My Recommended Learning Path

After extensive experimentation, I've discovered the **perfect combination** for learning Go:

#### 🥇 **Step 1: Go Tour (Official Foundation)**

Start with [Go Tour](https://go.dev/tour/) - the official interactive tutorial that covers:

-   🎯 **Language fundamentals** - Variables, types, functions
-   🔄 **Control structures** - If/else, loops, switch
-   📦 **Data structures** - Arrays, slices, maps
-   🏗️ **Structs and interfaces** - Go's approach to OOP
-   🚀 **Concurrency** - Goroutines and channels
-   🌐 **Web basics** - HTTP servers and clients

#### 🥈 **Step 2: Exercism (Practical Application)**

Reinforce learning with [Exercism's Go exercises](https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises):

-   🏋️ **Real-world problems** - 100+ exercises of increasing difficulty
-   ✅ **Automated testing** - Instant feedback on your solutions
-   👥 **Mentorship** - Get code reviews from experienced Gophers
-   🏆 **Gamified learning** - Track progress and earn achievements

### 🌟 Why This Dual Approach Works

Both platforms are **100% FREE** and complement each other perfectly:

| Feature            | Go Tour                      | Exercism                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 🎯 **Interactive** | Browser-based code execution | Local development environment  |
| 📚 **Theory**      | Comprehensive language tour  | Problem-specific learning      |
| 🏃‍♂️ **Practice**    | Built-in exercises           | 100+ real-world challenges     |
| 👥 **Community**   | Official Go team support     | Global developer community     |
| 🏆 **Progress**    | Chapter completion           | Exercise tracks & achievements |

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

This repository is organized by exercises, each containing:

```
📁 exercise-name/
├── 📝 README.md              # Exercise instructions
├── 🧪 *_test.go            # Unit tests
├── ⚙️ go.mod               # Go module file
├── 💡 HINTS.md             # Helpful hints
├── 🆘 HELP.md              # Additional help

```

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Go 1.19+](https://golang.org/dl/) installed
-   Basic terminal/command line knowledge

### Running the Exercises

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd learn-go

# Navigate to any exercise
cd hello-world/

# Run the tests
go test

# Run the tests with verbose output
go test -v

# Run the program directly
go run hello_world.go
```

## 🎯 Learning Path

My proven approach to mastering Go:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Go Tour)

1. **📚 Read** each Go Tour chapter thoroughly
2. **🎯 Experiment** with the interactive examples
3. **📝 Take notes** on language-specific features
4. **🔍 Understand** Go's philosophy and idioms

### Phase 2: Practice (Exercism)

1. **📝 Read** the exercise instructions carefully
2. **🧪 Understand** the test cases
3. **💡 Implement** the solution using tour knowledge
4. **🔄 Refactor** for better code quality
5. **📖 Document** interesting findings
